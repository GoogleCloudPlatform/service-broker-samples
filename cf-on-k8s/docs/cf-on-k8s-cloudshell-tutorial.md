# Install CF on GKE

## Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through installing a Cloud Foundry platform solely on GKE.
All necessary infrastructure will also be created.

## Prerequisites

Cloud foundry will be deployed as a subdomain under a given root domain.
Ensure that you have:

- created a GCP DNA Zone for the root zone
- configured the GCP DNS Zone with a registered domain.

## Installation

Fill out the terraform.tfvalues

Then run `terraform apply -auto-approve`

Then wait about 30 minutes

## Login

Login to your Cloud Foundry with `cf login --skip-ssl-verify`
Your username will be `admin`
Your password was generated by the Terraform. Get it with `this cool terraform command`

## Deploy an example application

Let's deploy a Hello World application to the Cloud Foundry
- download it
- run `cf push`
- watch the staging logs
- curl it

## Cleanup

Terraform can be used to completely wipe the environment. do `terraform destroy -auto-approve`

Would you like to keep this environment? We recommend GitOps.

Run `this command` to create a new Cloud Source Repositories + Cloud Build solution
